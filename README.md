# Gardener
(App was finished in fall 2020)
## The idea of the app is the following:
Create an app suitable for gardeners, where they can easily add events and own plants, save existed plants in "Favourite" section, see the moon calendar, and advises for planting.

# Further improvements
Application is almost done, but some improvements is needed:
1) Full fill the handbook
2) Full fill the advises
3) Clean up the code

The large piece of the remaining work is the full filling something, which is long and tedious process for me. To solve this problem expierenced in garden sense person is needed, since it's profeccional and can correct logical mistakes from the sites/book/etc.
